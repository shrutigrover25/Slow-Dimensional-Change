# üîÅ Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Backend System

A scalable backend system built in **Go (Golang)** that implements **Slowly Changing Dimensions Type-2 (SCD v2)** pattern across entities such as Jobs, Timelogs, and Payment Line Items. This design ensures historical tracking of updates using versioned records.

---

## üß† Overview

This system handles historical data changes without data loss, suitable for auditability, analytics, and data warehousing. It uses:
- `id` + `version` as the primary key
- `uid` as the public-facing stable identifier
- Each update creates a **new version** of a record while preserving the old

Use-cases:
- Track job versions over time
- Ensure consistency of related records via `uid`-based relations
- Perform clean updates with traceability

## üß† Architecture - SCD v2 Pattern

The system follows SCD Type-2 to maintain full history of record changes.  
Key Concepts:
- `id`: logical entity ID (remains same across versions)
- `uid`: unique version identifier (changes with each version)
- `version`: incremented for each update
- All foreign keys use `uid` (not `id`) to preserve exact relationships per version

| Entity     | ID      | UID  | Versioned Fields |
+------------+---------+------+------------------+
| Job        | ID      | UID  | Status, Title    |
| Timelog    | ID      | UID  | Time, Contractor |
| Payment    | ID      | UID  | Amount, IssuedAt |

üöÄ Clone & Run

git clone https://github.com/your-username/scd-backend.git
cd scd-backend
go mod tidy
go run cmd/main.go
üîß Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the config in db.Connect() is correct.

üå± Database Seeding

db.Seed(database)

Seed function auto-runs on startup and inserts:
* 4 Jobs (multiple versions)
* 3 Timelogs (linked to job versions)
* 2 Payment Line Items (linked to timelogs)
* All use realistic timestamps and UUIDs.

üéØ Design Principles
SCD Type 2: Preserves full history (new version, new UID)
Abstraction via SCD Manager: Reusable logic across entities
Separation of Concerns: Routes, handlers, services, repositories
UUID-based Foreign Keys: Maintains referential integrity across versions
